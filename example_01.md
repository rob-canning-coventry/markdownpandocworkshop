## Introduction

bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly,
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## Getting Started

## Markdown

>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

>“Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.
